h1. Intent : Abstract Resources


h2. Did you say "Abstract" ? 

See Eclipe Con example : the resource containing the emfCompareProduct has been defined for documentation purposes only : as it is an abstraction of the EMF Compare software, synchronizing it with some concrete and technical artifact has no meaning at all.

That is why we would like to introduce "Abstract" resources, that will not be synchronized.

Such a resource will still be built and validated by the compiler.

h2. Abstract resources : formal definition

Any Resource which is not associated to any URI is considered as Abstract, as there is no concrete artificats that we can use to synchronize it.

Example (default syntax) : 

bc.. 
@M
	Resource emfCompareProductResource {
		content += emfCompareProduct;
	}
M@
