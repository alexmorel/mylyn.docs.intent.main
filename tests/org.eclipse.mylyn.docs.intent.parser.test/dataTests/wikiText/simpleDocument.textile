h2. (c) Comparison (c) process

(c) The comparis2on (c) process is divided in 2 phases : matching and differencing. The matching phase browses both models trying to figure out which element of model
1 corresponds to which element of model 2. The differencing process then browses the result of the matching and creates the corresponding delta. The result of
both phases can be serialized as models.
